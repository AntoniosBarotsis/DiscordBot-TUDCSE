# TU Delft CSE Discord Bot - ARCHIVED

## Setup

Create a new file in the repository directory named "**.env**".
Put the following into that file:

> token=TOKEN

and replace "TOKEN" with your bot's private token (without quotation marks).
Git will ignore this hidden .env file and your token will not be made public.
